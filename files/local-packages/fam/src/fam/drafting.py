"""Drafts in the partner manager's voice: the kickoff text, conversation replies, and the revenue plan.

Two drafters share one interface:
  * TemplateDrafter  the framework in knowledge/funding/07-kickoff-framework.md, as code. Deterministic:
                     the simulation, the tests, and the floor when no model is configured.
  * ModelDrafter     the drafting model (fam.llm) working inside the same framework. Every model draft is
                     checked (length, one question, names, no AI talk, no claims) and replaced by the
                     template when it fails.

Messages are always signed by the partner's named manager. They never mention AI, drafting or an
assistant, and never claim anything about who is typing: identity questions go to the manager.
